# Rocket-Nozzle-Design
script to design a solid propellant rocket nozzle

The program calculates thrust generated and nozzle specifications for a range of combustion chamber pressures.

The combsution chamber pressure at equilibrium for a neutral-burn propellant grain is nearly constant which can be estimated by solving a differential equation relating propellant burn rate, grain geometry and temperature variables. This would give a narrower range of chamber pressure for analysis. This code uses a wider range of chamber pressures for simplicity and demo purposes. The chamber pressure calculation will be updated in future.
